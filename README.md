chivalry-instagib
=================

Any tiny bit of damage causes a character to explode. Fun for the whole family.

This mod is provided as an example of a code mod that: 
- uses includes to reduce code duplication 
- uses a config file for easy server setup 
- uses localized strings to allow for translation

Using the .cmwsdk file from the Workshop, or after compiling and cooking this mod locally (setting the "modname" to "instagib"):


Start a server with ?modname=instagib on the command line (appended to the map). For example:

UDK.exe aoctd-frigid_p?modname=instagib ...


If you want to play offline, just use the 'open' console command, again appending ?modname

open aoctd-frigid_p?modname=instagib
