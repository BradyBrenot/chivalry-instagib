chivalry-instagib
=================

Any tiny bit of damage causes a character to explode. Fun for the whole family.

This is itended as a simple example code mod, demonstrating the use of include files to reduce code duplication, as well as how to create a mod configuration file that allows server operators to easily use the mod.

Using the .cmwsdk file from the Workshop, or after compiling and cooking this mod locally (setting the "modname" to "instagib"):


Start a server with ?modname=instagib on the command line (appended to the map). For example:

UDK.exe aoctd-frigid_p?modname=instagib ...


If you want to play offline, just use the 'open' console command, again appending ?modname

open aoctd-frigid_p?modname=instagib
